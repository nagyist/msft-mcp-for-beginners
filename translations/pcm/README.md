## Learning Objectives

By di end of dis curriculum, you go feel confident and excited about your new skills. Na wetin you go achieve be dis:

• **Understand MCP fundamentals**: You go sabi wetin Model Context Protocol be and why e dey change how AI applications dey work together, using analogies and examples wey make sense.

• **Build your first MCP server**: You go create working MCP server for your preferred programming language, starting wit simple examples and grow your skills step by step.

• **Connect AI models to real tools**: You go learn how to join AI models and real services, giving your applications powerful new abilities.

• **Implement security best practices**: You go understand how to keep your MCP implementations safe and secure, protecting both your applications and your users.

• **Deploy with confidence**: You go sabi how to carry your MCP projects from development go production, wit practical deployment strategies wey work for real world.

• **Join the MCP community**: You go become part of growing community of developers wey dey shape di future of AI application development. 

## Essential Background

Before we dive into MCP specifics, make we sure say you dey comfortable wit some foundational concepts. No worry if you no be expert for these areas - we go explain everything wey you need to know as we dey go!

### Understanding Protocols (The Foundation)

Think protocol like rules for conversation. When you call friend, both of una sabi say make una talk "hello" when una answer, take turns to talk, and talk "goodbye" when una finish. Computer programs need similar rules to communicate well.

MCP na protocol - set of agreed rules wey help AI models and applications get productive "conversations" wit tools and services. Just like how conversation rules dey make human communication smooth, MCP dey make AI application communication more reliable and powerful.

### Client-Server Relationships (How Programs Work Together)

You dey use client-server relationships every day! When you use web browser (di client) to visit website, you dey connect to web server wey go send you di page content. Di browser sabi how to ask for info, and di server sabi how to respond.

For MCP, we get similar relationship: AI models dey act as clients wey dey request info or actions, while MCP servers dey provide those capabilities. E be like say AI get helpful assistant (di server) wey e fit ask to do specific tasks.

### Why Standardization Matters (Making Things Work Together)

Imagine if every car manufacturer use different shape gas pumps - you go need different adapter for each car! Standardization mean say everybody agree on common way so things go work together well.

MCP dey provide dis standardization for AI applications. Instead make every AI model need custom code to work wit every tool, MCP create universal way for dem to communicate. This one mean say developers fit build tools once and make dem work wit many different AI systems.

## 🧭 Your Learning Path Overview

Your MCP journey na carefully structured to build your confidence and skills step by step. Every phase go introduce new concepts while e still dey reinforce wetin you don learn before.

### 🌱 Foundation Phase: Understanding the Basics (Modules 0-2)

Na here your adventure start! We go introduce you to MCP concepts using familiar analogies and simple examples. You go understand wetin MCP be, why e dey, and how e fit inside di bigger world of AI development.

• **Module 0 - Introduction to MCP**: We go start by exploring wetin MCP be and why e important for modern AI applications. You go see real-world examples of MCP for action and understand how e dey solve common problems wey developers dey face.

• **Module 1 - Core Concepts Explained**: Here you go learn di essential building blocks of MCP. We go use plenty analogies and visual examples to make sure these concepts feel natural and easy to understand.

• **Module 2 - Security in MCP**: Security fit sound fear, but we go show you how MCP get built-in safety features and teach you best practices wey go protect your applications from di start.

### 🔨 Building Phase: Creating Your First Implementations (Module 3)

Now di real fun start! You go get hands-on experience to build actual MCP servers and clients. No worry - we go start simple and guide you through every step.

Dis module get many hands-on guides wey go let you practice for your preferred programming language. You go create your first server, build client to connect to am, and even join am wit popular development tools like VS Code.

Every guide get complete code examples, troubleshooting tips, and explanations why we choose specific design. By di end of dis phase, you go get working MCP implementations wey you fit proud of!
