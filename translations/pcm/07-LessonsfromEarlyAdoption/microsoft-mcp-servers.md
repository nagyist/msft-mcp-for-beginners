### Wetin Be MCP Servers?

If you be beginner for Model Context Protocol (MCP), you fit dey ask: "Wetin be MCP server, and why e concern me?" Make we use simple example.

Think of MCP servers like special assistants wey dey help your AI coding partner (like GitHub Copilot) connect to other tools and services. Just like how you dey use different apps for your phone—one for weather, one for map, one for bank—MCP servers dey give your AI assistant power to work with different development tools and services.

### The Problem Wey MCP Servers Dey Solve

Before MCP servers, if you wan:
- Check your Azure resources
- Create GitHub issue
- Query your database
- Search documentation

You go need stop coding, open browser, go the website, and do the thing manually. Dis kain waka go dey break your flow and reduce your productivity.

### How MCP Servers Dey Change Your Development Experience

With MCP servers, you no need leave your development environment (like VS Code, Visual Studio, etc.). You fit just tell your AI assistant to help you do the work. For example:

**Before:**
1. Stop coding
2. Open browser
3. Go Azure portal
4. Find storage account details
5. Go back to VS Code
6. Continue coding

**Now:**
1. Ask AI: "Wetin be the status of my Azure storage accounts?"
2. Continue coding with the info wey AI give you

### Key Benefits for Beginners

#### 1. 🔄 **Stay Focused**
- No need to dey jump from one app to another
- Concentrate on the code wey you dey write
- Reduce the stress of managing different tools

#### 2. 🤖 **Use Natural Language**
- No need to cram SQL syntax, just talk wetin you need
- Forget Azure CLI commands, just explain wetin you wan do
- Make AI handle the technical wahala while you focus on the logic

#### 3. 🔗 **Connect Tools Together**
- Combine different services to create powerful workflows
- Example: "Get all recent GitHub issues and create Azure DevOps work items"
- Automate things without writing long scripts

#### 4. 🌐 **Join a Growing Ecosystem**
- Use servers wey Microsoft, GitHub, and other companies don build
- Mix tools from different vendors without stress
- Enjoy a standard system wey dey work with different AI assistants

#### 5. 🛠️ **Learn by Doing**

```
1. Code a feature
2. Open browser → Navigate to GitHub
3. Create an issue for testing
4. Open another tab → Check Azure docs for deployment
5. Open third tab → Look up database connection examples
6. Return to VS Code
7. Try to remember what you were doing
```

**With MCP servers:**
```
1. Code a feature
2. Ask AI: "Create a GitHub issue for testing this login feature"
3. Ask AI: "How do I deploy this to Azure according to the docs?"
4. Ask AI: "Show me the best way to connect to my database"
5. Continue coding with all the information you need
```

**Wetin e dey do**: Azure MCP Server na one full package wey get more than 15 special Azure service connectors wey go carry all Azure things enter your AI workflow. No be just one server e be – na one strong collection wey include resource management, database connection (PostgreSQL, SQL Server), Azure Monitor log analysis with KQL, Cosmos DB integration, and plenty other things.

**Why e dey useful**: No be only to manage Azure resources, this server go help you make your code better when you dey use Azure SDKs. If you use Azure MCP for Agent mode, e no go just help you write code – e go help you write *better* Azure code wey follow the latest authentication patterns, error handling best practices, and use the newest SDK features. Instead of getting random code wey fit work, you go get code wey follow Azure's recommended patterns for production workloads.

**Key modules wey dey include**:
- **🗄️ Database Connectors**: Natural language access to Azure Database for PostgreSQL and SQL Server
- **📊 Azure Monitor**: Log analysis and operational insights wey dey powered by KQL
- **🌐 Resource Management**: Full Azure resource lifecycle management
- **🔐 Authentication**: DefaultAzureCredential and managed identity patterns
- **📦 Storage Services**: Blob Storage, Queue Storage, and Table Storage operations
- **🚀 Container Services**: Azure Container Apps, Container Instances, and AKS management
- **Plenty other special connectors**

**Real-world use**: "List my Azure storage accounts", "Query my Log Analytics workspace for errors wey happen in the last hour", or "Help me build one Azure application wey dey use Node.js with proper authentication"

**Full demo scenario**: This na one full walkthrough wey go show how Azure MCP and GitHub Copilot for Azure extension for VS Code fit work together. If you don install both and you ask:

> "Create one Python script wey go upload file to Azure Blob Storage using DefaultAzureCredential authentication. The script go connect to my Azure storage account wey dem call 'mycompanystorage', upload to one container wey dem call 'documents', create one test file wey get current timestamp to upload, handle errors well and give better output, follow Azure best practices for authentication and error handling, include comments wey explain how DefaultAzureCredential authentication dey work, and make the script well-structured with proper functions and documentation."

Azure MCP Server go generate one complete, production-ready Python script wey:
- Use the latest Azure Blob Storage SDK with proper async patterns
- Implement DefaultAzureCredential with full fallback chain explanation
- Get strong error handling with specific Azure exception types
- Follow Azure SDK best practices for resource management and connection handling
- Provide detailed logging and better console output
- Create one well-structured script wey get functions, documentation, and type hints

Wetin make this thing special be say without Azure MCP, you fit get random blob storage code wey fit work but e no go follow current Azure patterns. With Azure MCP, you go get code wey use the latest authentication methods, handle Azure-specific error scenarios, and follow Microsoft's recommended practices for production applications.

**Featured example**: I don struggle plenty times to remember the exact commands for `az` and `azd` CLIs for quick use. E dey always be two-step process for me: first I go check the syntax, then I go run the command. Sometimes I go just enter the portal and dey click around to finish work because I no wan admit say I no remember CLI syntax. To fit describe wetin I want dey sweet, and e even better say I fit do am without leaving my IDE!

Dem get one better list of use cases for the [Azure MCP repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#-what-can-you-do-with-the-azure-mcp-server) wey fit help you start.

**Full demo scenario**: This na one strong workflow wey dey show GitHub MCP Server power:

> "I need to prepare for our sprint review. Show me all pull requests wey I don create this week, check the status of our CI/CD pipelines, create one summary of any security alerts wey we need to address, and help me draft release notes based on merged PRs wey get the 'feature' label."

GitHub MCP Server go:
- Query your recent pull requests with full status information
- Analyze workflow runs and highlight any failures or performance issues
- Compile security scanning results and prioritize critical alerts
- Generate full release notes by extracting information from merged PRs
- Provide actionable next steps for sprint planning and release preparation

**Featured example**: I dey enjoy using this for code review workflows. Instead of dey jump between VS Code, GitHub notifications, and pull request pages, I fit talk "Show me all PRs wey dey wait for my review" and then "Add comment to PR #123 wey dey ask about the error handling for the authentication method." The server go handle the GitHub API calls, keep context about the discussion, and even help me write better review comments.

**Authentication options**: The server dey support both OAuth (e dey easy for VS Code) and Personal Access Tokens, with configurable toolsets to enable only the GitHub functionality wey you need. You fit run am as remote hosted service for quick setup or locally via Docker for full control.

> **💡 Pro Tip**
> 
> Enable only the toolsets wey you need by configuring the `--toolsets` parameter for your MCP server settings to reduce context size and make AI tool selection better. For example, add `"--toolsets", "repos,issues,pull_requests,actions"` to your MCP configuration args for core development workflows, or use `"--toolsets", "notifications, security"` if na GitHub monitoring capabilities you dey focus on.

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_MarkItDown_MCP-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=MarkItDown%20MCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40microsoft%2Fmcp-markitdown%40latest%22%5D%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_MarkItDown_MCP-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=MarkItDown%20MCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40microsoft%2Fmcp-markitdown%40latest%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_Repository-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)

**Wetin e dey do**: MarkItDown na one kain server wey dey convert different file formats go better Markdown wey AI fit use well and e dey good for text analysis workflows.

**Why e dey useful**: E dey very important for modern documentation workflows! MarkItDown sabi handle plenty file formats and e dey make sure say e no spoil important document structure like headings, lists, tables, and links. Unlike tools wey just dey extract text anyhow, e dey focus on keeping the meaning and formatting wey go make sense for AI and human beings.

**File formats wey e support**:
- **Office Documents**: PDF, PowerPoint (PPTX), Word (DOCX), Excel (XLSX/XLS)
- **Media Files**: Images (with EXIF metadata and OCR), Audio (with EXIF metadata and speech transcription)
- **Web Content**: HTML, RSS feeds, YouTube URLs, Wikipedia pages
- **Data Formats**: CSV, JSON, XML, ZIP files (e dey process contents inside am one by one)
- **Publishing Formats**: EPub, Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
- **Email**: Outlook messages (.msg)
- **Advanced**: Azure Document Intelligence integration for better PDF processing

**Advanced capabilities**: MarkItDown fit use LLM-powered image descriptions (if you get OpenAI client), Azure Document Intelligence for better PDF processing, audio transcription for speech content, and e get plugin system wey fit extend am to other file formats.

**Real-world use**: "Convert this PowerPoint presentation to Markdown for our documentation site", "Extract text from this PDF wey get correct heading structure", or "Change this Excel spreadsheet to readable table format"

**Featured example**: As dem talk for [MarkItDown docs](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown#why-markdown):

> Markdown dey very close to plain text, e no get plenty formatting, but e still dey represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, like OpenAI's GPT-4o, sabi Markdown well well, and dem dey use am for their response even if you no ask dem. This one mean say dem don train on plenty Markdown-formatted text, and dem understand am well. Another good thing be say Markdown dey save tokens.

MarkItDown sabi keep document structure well, wey dey important for AI workflows. For example, if e dey convert PowerPoint presentation, e go keep slide organization with correct headings, extract tables as Markdown tables, include alt text for images, and e go even process speaker notes. Charts go turn to readable data tables, and the Markdown wey e go produce go still dey follow the original presentation flow. This one make am perfect for AI systems or to create documentation from slides.

**Wetin e dey do**: E dey allow AI agents interact with web pages for testing and automation.

> **ℹ️ Powering GitHub Copilot**
> 
> The Playwright MCP Server dey power GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent, wey give am web browsing capabilities! [Learn more about this feature](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-02-copilot-coding-agent-now-has-its-own-web-browser/).

**Why e dey useful**: E dey perfect for automated testing wey natural language descriptions dey drive. AI fit navigate websites, fill forms, and extract data through structured accessibility snapshots – na serious power be this!

**Real-world use**: "Test the login flow and confirm say dashboard dey load well" or "Generate test wey go search for products and check the results page" – all this one no need the application's source code.

**Featured example**: My teammate Debbie O'Brien don dey do better work with Playwright MCP Server recently! For example, she show how you fit generate complete Playwright tests even if you no get access to the application's source code. For her example, she ask Copilot to create test for one movie search app: navigate to the site, search for "Garfield," and confirm say the movie dey show for results. The MCP open browser session, check the page structure using DOM snapshots, find the correct selectors, and generate fully working TypeScript test wey pass for the first run.

The thing wey make this powerful na say e dey connect natural language instructions with executable test code. Traditional methods dey require manual test writing or access to the codebase for context. But with Playwright MCP, you fit test external sites, client applications, or do black-box testing wey no need code access.

**Real-world use**: "Set up new Dev Box wey get latest .NET SDK and configure am for our project", "Check status of all my development environments", or "Create standardized demo environment for our team presentations"

**Featured example**: I dey enjoy using Dev Box for personal development. My lightbulb moment na when James Montemagno explain how Dev Box dey good for conference demos, because e get super-fast ethernet connection no matter the conference / hotel / airplane wifi wey I dey use. In fact, I recently practice conference demo while my laptop dey tethered to my phone hotspot as I dey ride bus from Bruges to Antwerp! But my next step na to explore more team management for multiple development environments and standardized demo environments. Another big use case wey I dey hear from customers and coworkers na to use Dev Box for preconfigured development environments. For all these cases, using MCP to configure and manage Dev Boxes go allow you use natural language interaction, all while you dey inside your development environment.
